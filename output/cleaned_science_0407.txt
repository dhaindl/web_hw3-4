long-awaited asteroid sample land us ashley strickland cnn atlanta georgia update edt mon september asteroid sample collect nasa touch earth give scientist opportunity learn origin solar system capture piece massive space rock chance collide planet future first time agency accomplish featseven year launch space osiris-rex spacecraft flew earth sunday deliver pristine sample near-earth asteroid bennuosiris-rex stand origin spectral interpretation resource identification security regolith explorer lift begin orbit bennu spacecraft collect sample set lengthy return trip earth may mission travel billion mile total bennu backthe spacecraft drop sample capsule contain estimated ounce asteroid rock soil distance mile kilometer earth surface early sunday enter planet atmosphere et travel speed mile per hour kilometer per hour parachute deploy slow capsule gentle touchdown mile per hour kilometer per hour sample land defense department utah test training range minute enter atmosphere minute ahead schedulecongratulations osiris-rex team say nasa administrator bill nelson bring something extraordinary large asteroid sample receive earth mission prove nasa big thing thing inspire us thing unite us wasnt mission impossible impossible become possibleosiris-rex continue tour solar system spacecraft already set capture detailed look different asteroid name apophisthe mission new name osiris-apex origin spectral interpretation resource identification security-apophis explorerfour helicopter transport recovery research team landing site conducted assessment make sure capsule wasnt damage way say rich burn osiris-rex project manager nasas goddard space flight center greenbelt maryland team confirm capsule not_breached landingrecovery team train event month retrieve capsule safe say sandra freund osiris-rex program manager lockheed martin space partner nasa build spacecraft provide flight operation help recover capsulethe initial recovery team outfit protective glove mask ensure capsule cool enough touch give reach temperatures degree fahrenheit degree celsius reentry burn say team also ensure capsule battery didnt rupture leak toxic fumesa science team collect sample land site include air dust dirt particlesone key scientific objective osiris-rex return pristine sample pristine mean foreign material hamper investigation sample analysis say dante lauretta osiris-rex principal investigator university arizona tucson unlikely want make sure material utah range may interact sample well documentedlauretta work mission nearly twenty year remembers part idea present nasa lauretta present step way include capsule assemble instal spacecraft launch sunday one first people approach capsule land welcome homeit like see old friend hadnt see long time say want give hug one key moment see know pull incredible seem year ago come bea helicopter carry sample cargo net deliver temporary clean room near landing site within space curation team conduct nitrogen flow call purge prevent earth atmosphere enter sample canister contaminate large piece capsule strip away say nicole lunning osiris-rex curation lead nasas johnson space center houstona team prepare sample canister transport c- aircraft nasas johnson space center houston monday scientist expect remove lid see sample first time tuesdaythe recovery team also assess footage capture descent determine drogue parachute use initially stabilize capsule deploy time time expect release team unable see visual evidence main parachute responsible slow capsule safe landing speed also deploy earlybut end day main chute deploy basically correct sin may happen ahead say tim priser chief engineer deep space exploration lockheed martin touch like featherdetails sample reveal nasa broadcast johnson space center october science team not_have time fully assess sample researcher plan collect fine-grained material top canister tuesday quick analysis share october lauretta say initial analysis look presence mineral chemical element saidscientists analyze rock soil next two year dedicated clean room inside johnson space center sample also divide send laboratory around globe include osiris-rex mission partner canadian space agency japanese aerospace exploration agency sample remain pristine storage future generation good technology learn even whats possibleif government shutdown occur not_endanger curation safe handling asteroid sample say lori glaze director nasas planetary science divisioncertain step lead highly anticipate analysis possibly delay sample remain protected safe despite disruption schedule say news conference friday sample wait billion year human study take us little long think well okalong previously return sample asteroid ryugu japan hayabusa mission rock soil could reveal key information beginning solar system scientist believe carbonaceous asteroid bennu crash earth early planet formation deliver element like waterscientists believe asteroid bennu representative solar system old material forge large die star supernova explosion glaze say reason nasa invest mission devote small body increase understanding solar system form evolvedbut sample also provide insight bennu chance collide earth futureits crucial understand population near-earth asteroid may eventual collision course planet good grasp composition orbit key predict asteroid may close approach earth essential develop method deflect asteroid base composition
