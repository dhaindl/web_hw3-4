nasa complete first-ever sample return mission asteroid today science capsule contain material asteroid landing travel billion-mile journey asteroid bennu capsule release osiris-rex spacecraft pass earth morning enter atmosphere around mph osiris-rex mission launch collect much several hundred gram asteroid material could help scientist understand early stage solar system nasa invests small body mission like osiris-rex investigate rich population asteroid solar system give us clue solar system form evolve say melissa morris osiris-rex program executive mission overview brief origin story capsule release osiris-rex spacecraft pass earth morning science capsule slow parachute land department defense utah test training range et landing area choose large restricted airspace united state use previous nasa sample return mission like genesis stardust landing area mile mile entire mission require high level precision particularly spacecraft rendezvous asteroid collect sample really precise navigation require orbit bennu touch collect sample meter away target sandra freund osiris-rex program manager say pre-landing briefing illustrate kind navigation precision weve throughout mission recovery team collect sample utah desert helicopter carry sample take pm et capsule take temporary clean room first disassembly remove large part backshell undergo process call nitrogen purge nitrogen pump canister protect sample prevent earth atmosphere enter ship johnson space center houston texas canister open first time sample analyze photo george via getty image need asteroid sample really interested trace organic molecular chemistry dante lauretta osiris-rex principal investigator tell verge really want understand thing use biology today like amino acid make protein nucleic acid make gene form ancient asteroid body deliver earth space youre not_familiar model formation solar system idea might sound outlandish bordering fantastical actually fairly well-supported widely accept theory key element life come earth important clear theory not_that life arise elsewhere deliver earth rather basic building block life often refer organic compound could arrive billion year ago carry asteroid thats theory decade test scientist need access asteroidal material go visit asteroid use instrument spacecraft study good start kind detailed analysis scientist want require much big laboratory equip instrument like mile-wide type particle accelerator call synchrotron would impossible fit onto spacecraft form ancient asteroid body deliver earth space another option study meteorite piece matter include asteroid come space fall earth surface thats research perform historically use tiny fragment sample two problem approach firstly meteorite fall doesnt context solar system come researcher cant know origin see body close give important clue interpretation data secondly time meteorite pass earth atmosphere land may pick matter along way contaminate local environment scientist look trace organic compound need know anything find come space wasnt pick earth need asteroid sample pristine possible thats osiris-rex come worldwide effort osiris-rex mission first time nasa bring back sample asteroid follow footstep japanese space agency jaxa collect two asteroid sample historic hayabusa hayabusa mission though first hayabusa mission gather tiny amount material second mission manage return around five gram material asteroid ryugu osiris-rex return much material asteroid bennu around gram mean science particularly look small amount trace material researcher see two mission complementary rather competitive not_all asteroid say lauretta also member hayabusa team ryugu bennu similar spinning-top-like shape look different ryugu large red color bennu small blue scientist still arent sure difference color mean able analyze compare sample earth help understand asteroid similar differ look not_two sample analysis program one big sample analysis program lauretta say worldwide effort window early solar system scientist want understand earth form need look beyond planet solar system star system form enormous cloud gas collapse star center spin disk material around thats clear look star system also evidence solar system planet revolve around sun direction single plane support idea form single disk materialsome material coalesce planet sweep early asteroid number still exist today scientist want understand earth form need look beyond planet solar system fact estimate age solar system come date grain within meteorite fall earth thats earth factor like erosion plate tectonics recycle rock wipe away early history planet mean old rock find around billion year old material asteroid even old asteroid date million year earlier time old rock earth geologist want go back way beginning lauretta say fun thing youre look asteroid go literally beginning solar system bennu asteroid osiris-rex collect sample think make material around billion year old make potential time capsule early stage solar system researcher cant know age sure detailed analysis perform image nasa new asteroid target osiris-rex spacecraft drop capsule contain sample initial job spacecraft still space even though cant collect another sample still power propulsion system science instrument still operate rather waste craft become osiris-apex go study new target asteroid apophis fortunate chance orbital dynamic able rendezvous asteroid one famous solar system come close earth next year study april apophis gon na fly within kilometer surface earth altitude weather satellite orbit lauretta say big close flyby asteroid thousand year may even visible naked eye location earth osiris-apex able follow asteroid path around earth meet perform science observation sample asteroid bennu take special facility nasas johnson space center houston work begin understand chemistry precious commodity get sample back earth beginning science research team anxiously await culmination effort get one first people earth see capsule position desert go quite emotional moment lauretta say weve build test design thing year end long journey beginning next chapter
