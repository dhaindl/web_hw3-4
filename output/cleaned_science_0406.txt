long-awaited sample near-earth asteroid land us ashley strickland cnn atlanta georgia update edt mon september asteroid sample stow inside nasa spacecraft reach earth travel nearly year across spaceits nasas first time collect return asteroid sample spacealong previously return sample asteroid ryugu japan hayabusa mission rock soil could reveal insight beginning solar systemrather come land osiris-rex mission drop sample rock soil continue journey study another asteroidteams rehearse retrieve sample originally collect near-earth asteroid bennu drop utah desert september estimate osiris-rex collect ounce cup material bennuwe mere week away receive piece solar system history earth successful drop test ensures ready say nicola fox associate administrator nasas science mission directorate statement pristine material asteroid bennu help shed light formation solar system billion year ago perhaps even life earth beganits not_every day spacecraft release capsule carry rare asteroid sample planet intend deliver safely specific land siteyears hard work thousand people lead moment bennu sample arrive earthduring spring summer team practice recover sample capsule run scenario good bad could happen reentry daythe mission original goal retrieve pristine asteroid sample capsule crash-lands pop open sample could become contaminatedi immensely proud effort team pour endeavor say dante lauretta principal investigator osiris-rex university arizona tucson statement meticulous planning rehearsal prepare us collect sample bennu hone skill sample recoveryosiris-rex stand origin spectral interpretation resource identification security regolith explorer nasas first asteroid sample return mission spacecraft seven-year journey launch osiris-rex begin orbit bennu

cleanroom establish range june team prepare sample container transport c- aircraft nasas johnson space center houston september detail sample reveal public nasa broadcast johnson october team nasa lockheed martin space rehearse every possible step prepare delivery day freund saidrecently team use aircraft drop sample capsule collect prepare transportit also work challenge scenario command center spacecraft reboot bring safe mode transfer communication different center case network outagesthe team also prepare different land scenario hard landing capsule contain sample open unexpectedly team would assess whether sample could savedanother possibility spacecraft cant release sample september landing within range isnt viable burn say scenario sample would remain board spacecrafts orbit would bring capsule back earth attempt another release utah johnson space center history store handle analyze extraterrestrial material include lunar sample apollo mission nasa work create special facility johnson bennu sample year say kevin righter osiris-rex deputy curation leadthe dedicate cleanroom prevent potential cross contamination collection scientist analyze soil rock next two year material small grain sand christopher snead small-particle handle lead osiris-rex deputy curator johnsonwe develop custom tool carefully handle precious particle within new gloveboxes snead say statement refer box manage hazardous extraterrestrial materialthe sample reveal information formation history solar system well role asteroid help develop habitable planet earth scientist believe asteroid bennu crash earth early formation deliver element like waterthe sample divide send laboratory around globe include osiris-rex mission partner canadian space agency japanese aerospace exploration agency sample remain pristine storage future generation good technology learn even whats possiblethe asteroid solar system today leave early stage solar system history lauretta say literally look geologic material form earth even exist call grandfather rock one really represent origin come gift world
